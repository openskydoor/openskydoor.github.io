I'm a software engineer at Twitch working on Search. Previously I was engineering real estate valuation models at Opendoor, building faster and better analytics platform at Periscope Data (acquired by Sisense), and doing things (it's been a while now..) at Microsoft.

Before anyone was willing to pay me to do stuff, I was a student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne (M.S.), and at Duke University (B.S.).

I like building and studying all things related to machine learning, and depending on the season, other software engineering topics...

My blog is mostly aimed at explaining things at the level of software engineers who forgot most of university-level math..

Before computer science became my past time, music writing was... awkwardly presenting my [soundcloud link](https://soundcloud.com/sky-soyoun-lee).
