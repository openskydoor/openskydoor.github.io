I do machine learning related to ads at Pinterest. Previously I was engineering search ranking at Twitch, engineering real estate valuation models at Opendoor, building faster and better analytics platform at Periscope Data (acquired by Sisense), and improving Exchange deployment and customer information management for Office at Microsoft.

Before anyone was willing to pay me to do stuff, I was a student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne (M.S.), and at Duke University (B.S.).

I like building and studying all things related to machine learning, and depending on the season, other software engineering topics...

Before computer science became my past time, music writing was... awkwardly presenting my [soundcloud link](https://soundcloud.com/sky-soyoun-lee).
